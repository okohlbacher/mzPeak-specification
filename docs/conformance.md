# Conformance

## Minimum archive

A conformant archive MUST contain `mzpeak_index.json` at its root. All other members are
discovered through it; readers MUST NOT depend on member names other than `mzpeak_index.json`.
mzPeak files containing only metadata (no spectra, no chromatograms) are thus still legal
mzPeak archives. Additionally, any of the Parquet files **MAY** be empty but present, and readers must gracefully handle these files being valid schematically but containing no rows.

### Archive file order

There is no required order of files in an mzPeak archive. As a matter of course the `mzpeak_index.json` will be the last file written to a ZIP archive. Some data files rely on information from other files, making reading the archive incrementally impractical at this time. File names within the archive **SHOULD** be unique, but in some unusual scenarios a ZIP archive may contain multiple files with the same name, in which case the last instance **SHOULD** be used.

### Unpacked archives

The same requirements apply to an unpacked archive. There is no "ordering" on the host file system. File systems versioning is not considered here, but it is usually preferrable to use the latest version of the files in the unpacked archive.

## Conformant archive

A conformant archive **MUST**:

1. have `mzpeak_index.json` valid against `schema/mzpeak_index.json`, carrying `metadata.version`
   (SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`);
2. reference only present, valid Parquet files whose Arrow schema matches their
   `entity_type`/`data_kind`;
3. declare in `metadata.cv_list` every CV prefix used anywhere, with `uri` and `version`;
4. use exactly one signal layout per data/peak file (`point` or `chunk`), identified by the
   array-index `prefix`;
5. satisfy the [semantic invariants](#validation).

Additional members and metadata keys are permitted and MUST NOT cause rejection.

## Conformant writer

A conformant writer **MUST**:

- produce a conformant archive;
- write a Parquet **page index** for the index/coordinate columns;
- declare every CV used (version-pinned) in `cv_list`;
- record an array index sufficient to reconstruct every array **without parsing column names**.

## Conformant reader

A conformant reader **MUST**:

- resolve all members through `mzpeak_index.json`;
- support both the `point` and `chunk` layouts;
- treat `list`≡`large_list`, `string`≡`large_string`, `binary`≡`large_binary`;
- resolve signal columns and transforms **via the array index**, not by column name;
- resolve CV parameters by **accession** (name is advisory);
- ignore unrecognized members, columns, metadata keys, `entity_type`/`data_kind`, or CV terms
  without error, preserving their literal values.

## Validation

**Syntactic.** A conformant archive **MUST** satisfy:

- `mzpeak_index.json` and JSON metadata MUST validate against the `schema/` JSON Schemas;
- each Parquet file's Arrow schema MUST match this specification.

**Semantic.** A conformant archive **MUST** satisfy:

- parallel columns of an entity have equal length;
- the sorting-rank-0 coordinate array is ascending;
- every non-null foreign key resolves to an existing key/id;
- chunks of an entity are ascending by `chunk_start` and non-overlapping;
- within an entity, all `array_index` entries share one layout family — either every entry
  is `point` or every entry is one of the `chunk_*` formats; the two **MUST NOT** be mixed;
- time columns (for example `spectrum.time` and `wavelength_spectrum_time`) are expressed in
  [minutes](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UO_0000031);
- each signal Parquet file carries a [page index](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/pageindex/);
- `data_type`, `array_type`, and `unit` CURIEs in the array index descend from their required
  CV parents (`MS:1000518`, `MS:1000513`, and a unit term respectively).

The last four cannot be expressed in JSON Schema or the CvMapping rules, so a conformant
validator **MUST** check them programmatically.

## Conformance classes

**Core** — satisfies every MUST above. **Profiles** (OPTIONAL, e.g. *Imaging*) register through
the index extension mechanism and add requirements; a Core reader MUST still read Core content
and ignore profile content it does not implement.

## Demonstrating compliance

- Archives SHOULD pass the reference validator (mzPeakValidator) at both levels (syntactic, semantic).
- The specification ships a reference implementation and a public conformance **test corpus**.
- Specification conformance is demonstrated by independent implementations round-tripping the entire corpus and each other's output without loss.
