# Introduction

## Description of the need

## Issues to be addressed

## Notational conventions
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (2).

### Code samples

This document describes both a file format and a set of suggested algorithms for preparing data to be stored in that format. The original author (Joshua Klein), includes snippets of Python code to do these operations under the assumption that at this time most technical programmers will know Python, that Python is effectively executable pseudocode, save that the code snippets use three components, abstract base classes from the standard library for type annotations, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) v2.1 for certain array operations which are assumed to be understandable, and [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) v20.0 for operations on Apache Arrow arrays which are conceptually equivalent for in-memory representations of the data stored in Parquet files.

## Overview

### What _is_ mzPeak?

mzPeak is an archive of multiple [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files, stored directly in an _uncompressed_ [ZIP](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)>)
archive or unpacked directory/prefix. Each Parquet file describes a different facet of the stored mass spectrometry run. While the the data model draws on prior
art like mzML (https://peptideatlas.org/tmp/mzML1.1.0.html), it is not a direct re-implementation in a Parquet table. It does attempt
to re-use concepts like controlled vocabularies where feasible as well as arbitrary additional user metadata.

Components of an mzPeak archive:

- `mzpeak_index.json`: Definition of the files present in the archive, encoded as JSON. This makes resolving files by controlled terms easier than matching file names.
- `spectra_metadata.parquet`: Spectrum level metadata and file-level metadata. Includes spectrum descriptions, scans, precursors, and selected ions using packed parallel tables.
- `spectra_data.parquet`: Spectrum signal data in either profile or centroid mode. May be in point layout or chunked layout which have different size and random access characteristics.
- `spectra_peaks.parquet` (optional): Spectrum centroids stored explicitly separately from whatever signal is in `spectra_data.parquet`, such as from instrument vendors who store both profile and centroid versions of the same spectra. This file may not always be present.
- `chromatograms_metadata.parquet`: Chromatogram-level metadata and file-level metadata. Includes chromatogram descriptions, as well as precursors and selected ions using packed parallel tables.
- `chromatograms_data.parquet`: Chromatogram signal data. May be in point layout or chunked layout which have different size and random access characteristics. Intensity measures with different units may be stored in parallel.

and other Parquet files may be added to cover additional modalities as needed like the wavelength spectra.

## Anatomy of a Parquet file

This is a minimal overview of Parquet. For more details, please see <https://parquet.apache.org/> for further explanation.

### The schema

Parquet files contain a physical data schema defining how their data columns are encoded in bytes on disk. This schema supports arbitrary levels of nullability, nesting (groups) or repetition (lists). These physical data types may also be mapped to one or more "logical types".

There is a broader many-to-many mapping between Parquet schemas and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) schemas. Arrow supports many types that Parquet does not, but they share a common abstraction of columnar data storage with a notion of per-value nullability, and while they store these concepts differently, it is straight-forwards to convert from one to the other.

### The metadata key-value pairs

![Parquet schematic](https://parquet.apache.org/images/FileLayout.gif)

At the end of a Parquet file is a footer containing user-defined metadata along with the file's schema, offsets and search indices. This user-defined metadata is stored in key-value pairs, which makes it amenable to serializing light-weight, immediately interesting metadata there that do not make sense to force into the data columns.

### The columnar data

Parquet is a strongly typed binary columnar data format with layered blocked compression that permits a degree of random access.

As some languages do not have a concept of 64-bit addresses, all implementations _MUST_ handle both `large_*` and not `large_*` variants of collection arrays, `list`, `string`, and `binary` types.

#### Row Groups and Pages

TODO: write more here regarding compression vs. random access granularity. Lots of knobs to twist

#### Index levels

When writing an mzPeak archive, the writer **MUST** write a page index. Most libraries that write Parquet support writing the page index, even if they do not directly support reading informed by the page index.

TODO: write more here

## Container

### ZIP archives

In order to pack multiple Parquet tables together under a single file name on disk, we need a container file format. To that end we use the [ZIP](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/zip) archive to bundle multiple files together. ZIP files start with a header containing the magic bytes followed by a sequence of blocks of (header, file) pairs, terminating with a central directory listing how to find each file in the archive. Files saved in a ZIP may be stored compressed or uncompressed. When mzPeak is stored in a ZIP it **MUST** store its member files uncompressed. Files stored uncompressed can be read directly without requiring some intervening decompression to occur to reveal the Parquet file, and the Parquet file itself contains layered compression that is superior to that of most plain ZIP compressors.

#### Why not TAR?

TAR archives are designed for a linear traversal. In order to know all of the files in the archive, you must jump from header entry to header entry until you reach the end of the archive. Compared to ZIP's central directory index, this is less efficient and more expensive for object stores. TAR does not support per file encryption either, making protecting parts of the archive that are _not_ in Parquet more difficult.

### Unpacked archives

If an mzPeak archive is stored in an unpacked directory, the directory name is treated as the name of the name of the run file.

# Data Layouts

## Packed Parallel Metadata Tables

The `spectra_metadata.parquet` and `chromatograms_metadata.parquet` store multiple schemas in parallel. In these Parquet files, the root schema is made up of several branched "group" or "struct" (Parquet vs. Arrow nomenclature) that may be null at any level. We use relational database language, specifically, "primary key" and "foreign key" to describe the interconnections between the different tables that are packed together here.

Here is a stripped down example where two rows of related MS1 and MS2 spectra. Treat `scan.source_index`, `precursor.source_index`, `precursor.precursor_index`, `selected_ion.source_index`, and `selected_ion.precursor_index` as a foreign key with respect to `spectrum.index`, a primary key. `precursor.source_index` refers to the `spectrum` which this `precursor` record belongs to and `precursor.precursor_index` refers to the `spectrum` that is that _is_ the precursor of the `spectrum` referenced by `precursor.source_index`, and (`precursor.source_index`, `precursor.precursor_index`) forms a compound primary key. Any of these columns may be `null` which means that such a record does not exist in the table. This also applies to the `selected_ion` facet.

### Controlled Vocabulary Terms

Like mzML, mzPeak makes heavy use of controlled vocabularies for representing rich metadata. mzPeak uses controlled vocabulary terms in several ways:

1. As columns. When a term is used as a column name, that column's values are either the defined value of an expected type for the term (e.g. the term `has_value_type`) _OR_ the a CURIE for a child of the column name. For example
   1. The column [`MS_1000525_spectrum_representation`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1000525) would have values that are CURIEs for a child term, `MS:1000127` "centroid spectrum" or `MS:1000128` "profile spectrum", as appropriate for the spectrum the row is describing.
   2. The column [`MS_1000511_ms_level`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1000511) would hold an integer value, as appropriate for the spectrum the row is describing.
2. As structural elements. In several places in the format, like the [array index](#the-array-index), we use CURIEs to reference named concepts that explain the semantics of the data structure without changing the shape of the data structure.
3. As pluggable metadata carriers in `parameters` arrays, akin to `<cvParam />` in mzML. For every schema facet of a metadata table, a `parameters` column is allowed. See the [parameters list](#the-parameters-list) for details.

#### The `parameters` list

The `parameters` column may be present in any facet of a metadata table. It _MUST_ be a list of the following schema:
```python
optional group field_id=-1 parameters (List) {
  repeated group field_id=-1 list {
    optional group field_id=-1 item {
      optional group field_id=-1 value {
        optional int64 field_id=-1 integer;
        optional double field_id=-1 float;
        optional binary field_id=-1 string (String);
        optional boolean field_id=-1 boolean;
      }
      optional binary field_id=-1 accession (String);
      optional binary field_id=-1 name (String);
      optional binary field_id=-1 unit (String);
    }
  }
}
```

The `parameters.list.item.value` group must have a column for each data type so a parameter can take on one of these value types. Unused type slots _MUST_ be `null`. (QUESTION: Should this support lists/maps?). `parameters` entries _MAY_ have unit defined by a controlled vocabulary term CURIE stored in the `parameters.list.item.unit` column. As in mzML's `<userParam />`, uncontrolled parameters may also be included in the `parameters` list by simply storing a parameter _WITHOUT_ a value in the `parameters.list.item.accession` column.

__NOTE:__ Parquet columns _MUST_ be uniquely named, so if a parameter is present multiple times in single entry it _MUST_ be stored in the `parameters` column.

__NOTE:__ Writers are encouraged to, when sufficient context is available, encode parameters that are present in most rows of a table as columns. This is more space efficient and opens the door to easy predicate filtering.

#### Typing Parameter Values

When a term has a value, if it is stored in the `parameters` list, the value _MUST_ be stored using one of the provided value types as given by the fixed schema. When storing a term that has been encoded as a separate column, values can be stored in any data type supported by Parquet. This flexibility allows us to pick a physical type that uses an appropriate size and precision for the value being stored, but can also create a lot of redundant code to handle a column that we expect contains an integer but whether the file was written using an 8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit integer, and whether it was stored signed or unsigned. Some languages can handle these naturally using dynamic typing or templates, while others require manually repeat implementations for each type a column might use.

- For integral value types that are _NOT_ indices or unique identifiers, prefer signed 32- or 64-bit values as needed to cover the domain of the value being stored.
- For indices or unique identifiers represented as integers, prefer unsigned 32- or 64-bit types. Dictionary encoding will reduce the majority of cases to 8 bits per variant on disk in any case.
- For floating point values, prefer 64-bit floats/doubles unless the value's precision is truly of no issue. If the value is repetitive, e.g. collision energy, dictionary encoding will reduce the storage cost below 32 bits per value on disk.
- For strings and lists, prefer storing 64-bit offsets ("large strings" and "large lists"), but code must be written to support both 32-bit and 64-bit offsets. This is especially true of strings where the offset is in terms of total byte offsets, not item offsets but.

#### Column Name Inflection

When representing a controlled vocabulary term concept as a column in the table, the column name _SHOULD_ use the following inflection rules to construct the column name:

1. The base column name is `${CV_CODE}_${CV_ACCESSION}_${CLEANED_NAME}` where:
   1. `${CV_CODE}` is the identifier for the controlled vocabulary itself, `MS` for PSI-MS or `UO` for the unit ontology.
   2. `${CV_ACCESSION}` is the accession number. `MS:1000016` for "scan start time" would be `1000016`.
   3. `${CLEANED_NAME}` is the term's name with any non-Parquet column compatible characters replaced with `_`. The regular expression `/[^a-zA-Z0-9_\\\\-]+/` is sufficient to match all of these characters in ASCII. For `MS:1000016` for "scan start time", this would be `MS_1000016_scan_start_time`
   4. The string "m/z" appears so frequently it _SHOULD_ be rewritten `mz` to avoid unnecessary additional underscores. For `MS:1000504` for "base peak m/z", this would be written `MS_1000504_base_peak_mz`.
2. _IF_ there is a single unit kind specified for all values in the column it _SHOULD_ be specified by appending `_unit_${UNIT_CV_CODE}_${UNIT_CV_ACCESSION}` to the inflected name. `MS_1000528_lowest_observed_mz_unit_MS_1000040` would correspond to `MS:1000528` "lowest observed m/z" with a unit of `MS:1000040` "m/z".
3. _IF_ the unit for this column varies it _SHOULD_ be specified as a separate column with `_unit` appended to the column name whose value is the unit's CURIE.

### Null Semantics for Metadata

A row value that is `null` should be treated as being absent, having no value. If a foreign key column is `null`, assume the entry does not exist in the table, as in the case where an MS2 spectrum is stored without MS1 spectra as in MGF files, or a slice of an MS run. If it is the primary key of the table, the reader _SHOULD_ skip of the columns in that row for that table.

A writer implementation is _SHOULD_ to minimize the number of interspersed rows that are `null`, but this is not strictly required. Minimizing the interspersed nulls improves compressability. See the images below, the "Packed Tables" has all of the rows of each parallel table contiguous, while the "Sparse Tables" diagram shows rows of nulls intermixed

<img src="static/img/packed_tables.png" width="40%" style="background-color: white; padding: 1em;"/> <img src="static/img/sparse_tables.png" width="40%" style="background-color: white; padding: 1em;"/>

### File-Level Metadata

Some metadata is descriptive of the entire run and does not make sense to store in the rows of a table. This data is stored as JSON in the [Parquet key-value metadata](#the-metadata-key-value-pairs) of the `metadata` [data kind](#data-kind) files.

## Signal Data Layouts

### Arrays and Columns

It is common in mass spectrometry to talk about a spectrum _having_ an m/z array as synonymous with having been measured in the m/z dimension, and those m/z values are represented using some kind of physical data type in memory, likewise having an intensity array corresponding to the abundance of the signal parallel to the m/z array. In mzML, it is possible to use different physical data types for these two dimensions on different spectra in the same file, and there may well be legitimate use-cases for that. mzPeak can store array data in two ways. One way to store the arrays as columns in a signal data layout, burning the column into the schema and added to the `array index`. Another way is to store it as an `auxiliary array` which will be stored in the associated metadata table's `*.auxiliary_arrays` value for that entity's row. Auxiliary data arrays can be individually configured by the writer, have custom compression or data type decoding or cvParams, but it cannot be searched or sliced (read a segment of) without decoding the entire array, just as in mzML. By contrast, any array that is written as a column is encoded directly in Parquet, is part of the schema, and subject to its adaptive encoding process and compression. Currently, we assume that the first sorted array is the axis around which all other values are arranged, sorting rank 0, and any arrays that are shorter or longer _SHOULD_ instead be stored in `auxiliary_arrays` as well.

When writing, if an array with a sorting rank is unsorted, the entry's data arrays **MUST** be re-sorted accordingly. Failure to do so introduces integrity errors.

### The Array Index

In order to properly annotate what kind of array a column _is_, we include a JSON-serialized `array index` in the [Parquet key-value metadata](#the-metadata-key-value-pairs), an list of data structures that describe each array in controlled vocabulary. A column is part of the Parquet file's schema and must always exist and have a homogenous type of value or a be marked `null` for each row. The `array index` is stored in the Parquet metadata for the [`data arrays`](#data-kind) or [`peaks`](#data-kind) files under `<entity_type>_array_index`, e.g. `spectrum_array_index` for spectra or `chromatogram_array_index`.

```json
{
  "prefix": "point",
  "entries": [
    {
      "context": "spectrum", // This is an array describing a spectrum
      "path": "point.mz", // The path to the column for this array in the Parquet schema
      "data_type": "MS:1000523", // The controlled vocabulary term  for the data type of this array
      "array_type": "MS:1000514", // The controlled vocabulary term for the array itself
      "array_name": "m/z array", // A human readable name and a place to store a custom name through `non-standard array`
      "unit": "MS:1000040", // The values in this array have the unit m/z
      "buffer_format": "point", // This column uses the point layout
      "transform": null, // No transformation was applied to this data
      "data_processing_id": null, // No specific data processing pipeline was applied, use the default data processing method
      "buffer_priority": "primary", // This is the primary m/z array, default all queries to read this column when looking for m/z values
      "sorting_rank": 0 // This array's column is assumed to be sorted within entries, with all other arrays' columns sorted afterwards
    },
    {
      "context": "spectrum",
      "path": "point.intensity",
      "data_type": "MS:1000521",
      "array_type": "MS:1000515",
      "array_name": "intensity array",
      "unit": "MS:1000131", // The unit of this array is detector counts
      "buffer_format": "point",
      "transform": null,
      "data_processing_id": null,
      "buffer_priority": "primary",
      "sorting_rank": null // This array does not impose any sorting order on the data
    }
  ]
}
```

This array index describes the table shown below for the [`point layout`](#example-point-table)

Governed by `schema/array_index.json`.

#### Buffer Format

Depending upon the signal data layout being used, arrays will be stored in different formats.

Available formats:
 - `point`: This array is stored using the [`point`](#point-layout) layout. The `point` layout is all-or-nothing, every array _MUST_ be in that format.
 - `chunk_values`: This array is part of the [`chunked`](#chunked-layout) layout. It contains the list of values of the "main" axis bounded between the chunk's start and end point. These values are encoded to be more compressable. This encoding is _in addition_ to the Parquet encoding step.
 - `chunk_start`: This array is part of the [`chunked`](#chunked-layout) layout. It contains the starting value of the "main" axis for the chunk, inclusive.
 - `chunk_end`: This array is part of the [`chunked`](#chunked-layout) layout. It contains the ending value of the "main" axis for the chunk, inclusive. It sjould be less than the next chunk's `chunk_start` value.
 - `chunk_encoding`: This array is part of the [`chunked`](#chunked-layout) layout. It contains a CURIE indicating how `chunk_values` was encoded.
 - `chunk_secondary`: This array is part of the [`chunked`](#chunked-layout) layout. It contains the list of values of an array other than the main axis for the chunk.
 - `chunk_transform`: This array is part of the [`chunked`](#chunked-layout) layout. It contains the list of raw byte contents of an array in the chunk that was opaquely transformed, e.g. using MS-Numpress. It may be present in addition to a referenced `chunk_values` or `chunk_secondary` column.

Currently the `chunked` layout only supports a single chunking dimension. A single file in the `chunked` layout **MUST** use `chunk_start`, `chunk_end`, `chunk_encoding`, and `chunk_values` EXACTLY once.

#### Buffer Priority, Naming

In Parquet, all column names and types need to be known before you can begin writing, and no two columns can have the same name + path. Normally, we have a coordinate array column (e.g. m/z or time) and an intensity array column. If you have intensity arrays with different units or different data types, they would need to be defined as separate arrays in the [array index](#the-array-index) and thus have distinct names. While this case may be uncommon for spectra, when working with diagnostic traces stored as chromatograms this can be unavoidable. For ergonomics, we want to use simple column names most of the time, and it would be ideal if the most common columns had consistent names as this makes using files from raw Parquet tools easier. To that end, the most common (as defined by the implementation) version of each array type _SHOULD_ have a `buffer_priority` property of `primary` and receive a short and consistent name. The [table](#array-name-recommendations) below lists recommended short names:

### Data Arrays, Encoding, Transformations and Parquet

Parquet can write [page indices](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/pageindex/) on any column that is a _leaf_ node in the schema based upon the value being stored prior to applying [encoding](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/) and [compression](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/compression/). To that effect, we must take care when trying to store data cleverly. The following section may refer to spectra, but these are applicable more broadly.

#### Zero Run Stripping

When storing spectrum data, some vendors will produce arrays with lots of "empty" regions filled with zero intensity values along a semi-regularly spaced m/z axis. These regions hold little information, so all but the first and last zero intensity points are removed. This is only meaningful for profile data. Readers SHOULD assume that zero runs have been stripped.

##### Null Marking

For spectra with many small gaps, even zero run stripping leaves too much unhelpful information in the data. We can instead replace the flanking zero intensity points with `null` m/z and intensity values and Parquet will skip storing the expensive 32- and/or 64-bit values, retaining only the validity buffer bit flag. We can separately fit a simple m/z spacing model using weighted least squares of the form:

$$
    \delta mz \sim β_0 + β_1 mz + β_2 mz^2 + ϵ
$$

or using the following Python code:

<details>
<summary>Python code for fitting the weighted least squares model</summary>

```python
class DeltaCurveRegressionModel:
    beta: np.ndarray

    def __init__(self, beta: np.ndarray):
        self.beta = beta

    @classmethod
    def fit(
        cls,
        mz_array,
        delta_array,
        weights: np.ndarray | None = None,
        threshold: float | None = None,
        rank: int = 2,
    ):
        if weights is None:
            weights = np.ones(len(mz_array))
        else:
            weights = weights

        if threshold is None:
            threshold = 1.0

        # Drop all entries where the gap between m/z values > threshold
        raw = mz_array[1:][delta_array <= threshold]
        w = weights[1:][delta_array <= threshold]
        y = delta_array[delta_array <= threshold]

        # Build the design matrix
        data = [data.append(np.ones_like(raw))]
        for i in range(1, rank + 1):
            data.append(raw**i)
        data = np.stack(data, axis=-1)

        # Use the QR decomposition to solve the weighted least squares problem
        # to estimate weights predicting δ m/z.
        # https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/490782/59613
        chol_w = np.sqrt(w)
        qr = np.linalg.qr(chol_w[:, None] * data)
        v = qr.Q.T.dot(chol_w * y)
        beta = solve_triangular(qr.R, v)

        # Numerically equivalent to and more stable than the direct inversion
        # beta = np.linalg.inv((data.T * w).dot(data)).dot(data.T * w).dot(y)
        return cls(beta)

    def predict(self, mz: float) -> float:
        acc = self.beta[0]
        for i in range(1, len(self.beta)):
            acc += self.beta[i] * mz ** i
        return acc
```

</details>

Then when reading the the null-marked data, use either the local 2nd median $δ mz$ or the learned model for that spectrum to compute the m/z spacing for singleton points to achieve a very accurate reconstruction. Because the non-zero m/z points remain unchanged, the reconstructed signal's peak apex or centroid should be unaffected. If the peak is composed of only three points including the two zero intensity spots, no meaningful peak model can be fit in any case so the miniscule angle change this would induce are still effectively lossless. The parameters of the model learned for each entry _MUST_ be stored in the relevant entry's row in the associated metadata table as `mz_delta_model` (QUESTION: should this become a CV param and dissociate it from m/z? Probably).

![Thermo dataset with null marking](static/img/thermo_null_marking_err.png)
![Sciex dataset with delta encoding and null marking](static/img/sciex_null_marking_delta_encoding_error.png)

Keep in mind that all Numpress compression methods are still available and still provide superior size reduction, but carry this slightly larger loss of accuracy. Using a Numpress compression is a transformation that requires the [Chunked Layout](#chunked-layout).

###### Removing Zero Runs

A zero run is defined explicitly as a sequence of 3 or more zero values that should be reduced to just the first and last positions in the run. Zero runs can be very long and outside of certain scenarios which assume a complete grid of coordinate values, provide no value. If zero runs need to be reconstructed beyond the flanking points left at the end of these runs, the same method used to fill in `null`s here can be used to extend zero runs.

<details>
<summary>Python code for finding zero runs</summary>

```python
def find_where_not_zero_run(data: Sequence[Number]) -> Sequence[int]:
    """
    Construct a list of positions that are not part of a zero run.

    A zero run is any position *i* such that:
      1. ``x[i] == 0``
      2. ``(i == 0) or (x[i - 1] == 0)``
      3.``(i == (len(x) - 1)) or (x[i + 1] == 0)``

    We build a position list here because we need to extract these positions
    from ALL dimension arrays for this entity, not just the current array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : :class:`Sequence` of :class:`Number`
        The numerical data to traverse

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`np.ndarray` of :class:`np.uintp`
    """
    n = len(data)
    n1 = n - 1

    was_zero = False

    acc = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        v = data[i]
        if v is not None:
            if v == 0:
                if (was_zero or (len(acc) == 0)) and ((i < n1 and data[i + 1] == 0) or i == n1):
                    pass
                else:
                    acc.append(i)
                was_zero = True
            else:
                acc.append(i)
                was_zero = False
        else:
            acc.append(i)
            was_zero = False
        i += 1
    return np.array(acc, dtype=np.uintp)
```

</details>

###### Finding Flanking Zero Pairs

Zero intensity points on the sides of peaks still use non-trivial amounts of storage in sparse datasets. This step does _not_ match all zero intensity points, only those that occur on the flanks of profile peaks. Once these indices are found, they can be used to construct the `null` mask or "validity bitmap" of an Arrow array which is equivalent to how a Parquet column chunk would be constructed.

<details>
<summary>Python code for finding flanking zeros</summary>

```python
def is_zero_pair_mask(data: Sequence[Number]) -> "np.typing.NDArray[np.bool_]":
    '''
    Create a boolean mask for positions that are composed of two zeroes in a row.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : :class:`Sequence` of :class:`Number`
        The numerical data to traverse

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`np.ndarray` of :class:`bool`
    '''
    n = len(data)
    n1 = n - 1
    was_zero = False
    acc = []
    for i, v in enumerate(data):
        if v == 0:
            if was_zero or (i < n1 and data[i + 1] == 0):
                acc.append(True)
            else:
                acc.append(False)
            was_zero = True
        else:
            acc.append(False)
            was_zero = False
    return np.array(acc)
```

</details>

###### Decoding Null Pairs

Decoding null pairs, the process of undoing [`null marking`](#null-marking) involves finding regions bounded between two `null`s, or the start of the array and a `null`, or a `null` and the end of the array, then filling the null values with either a locally estimated value when you have more than one value to estimate the median delta from, or to use the regression model described ealier to impute the value for a single point. Unpaired `null` values _MAY_ only be found as the first or last `null` in the array, any other unpaired `null`s are unrecoverable errors. A run of three or more `null` values is encountered, it _MAY_ be recoverable but should not occur under normal operation.

The locally estimated value _SHOULD_ be the second median of the spacing of the current segment's non-`null` values. The regression model is used to predict the spacing from the non-null value within a segment with only one non-null value.

<details>
<summary>Python code for filling <em>null</em> marked values</summary>

```python

def find_pairs(mask: Sequence[bool]) -> Sequence[int]:
    """
    Construct index ranges between pairs of :const:`True` values in
    ``mask``.

    The first and last index range will include the beginning and ending
    of the array respectively, even if the mask does not start/end with a
    :const:`True` value.

    The resulting array will have two columns, the start and end indices
    of the spans between two :const:`True` values (or the termini of the array).

    .. warning::
      This function *can* fail or produce incorrect output if there are runs of
      :const:`True` values longer than 2 in the ``mask``. It is also necessary to
      buffer all data for an entry before invoking this function so that batches
      do not artificially disrupt pairs.

##### Null Semantics for Signal Data

Unless otherwise noted, readers _SHOULD_ treat `null` values in the sorting rank 0 array of the entry as governed by this model with parallel `null` values in any intensity arrays as 0. The former should have a `transformation` value of [`MS:1003901`]() and the latter should have a `transformation` value [`MS:1003902`](). All other values for those points should be read as-is with null semantics meaning that the value was absent. Writers using null marking _SHOULD_ only use `null` for the first sorting dimension and associated intensity value, all other columns should be written as-is.

### Auxiliary Data Arrays

When an array is present in an entry, but is not encoded as a column in the schema, it must be stored as an auxiliary array. This can happen when mixing different kinds of detectors in a single collection, or especially with diagnostic traces where every array might have different dimensions along a shared time axis or subsampled arrays. Auxiliary data arrays have a schema similar to [`binaryDataArray`](https://peptideatlas.org/tmp/mzML1.1.0.html#binaryDataArray) in mzML, encoded in Parquet. They are described in JSON schema at [schema/auxiliary_array.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobiusklein/mzpeak_prototyping/refs/heads/main/schema/auxiliary_array.json)

```
optional group auxiliary_arrays (List) {
  repeated group list {
    optional group item {
      optional group data (List) {
        repeated group list {
          required int32 item (Int(bitWidth=8, isSigned=false));
        }
      }
      optional group name {
        optional group value {
          optional int64 integer;
          optional double float;
          optional binary string (String);
          optional boolean boolean;
        }
        optional binary accession (String);
        optional binary name (String);
        optional binary unit (String);
      }
      optional binary data_type (String);
      optional binary compression (String);
      optional binary unit (String);
      optional group parameters (List) {
        repeated group list {
          optional group item {
            optional group value {
              optional int64 integer;
              optional double float;
              optional binary string (String);
              optional boolean boolean;
            }
            optional binary accession (String);
            optional binary name (String);
            optional binary unit (String);
          }
        }
      }
      optional binary data_processing_ref (String);
    }
  }
}
```

### Point Layout

When storing data arrays, the point layout stores the data as-is in parallel arrays alongside a repeated index column. The top-level node is named `point` and it is a group with an arbitrary number of columns. The entity index column _MUST_ be the first column under `point`.

<img src="static/img/point_layout.png" height="600pt" style="background-color: white; padding: 1em;"/>

<style style="display: none">
  .point-table {
    text-align: center;
  }

  .point-table thead th {
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
<table id="example-point-table" class="point-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan=3>point</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>spectrum_index</th>
      <th>mz</th>
      <th>intensity</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>213.2</td><td>1002</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1 </td> <td>506.9</td><td>500</td> </tr>
    <tr><td>1 </td>  <td>758</td><td>405</td> </tr>
    <tr><td>...</td> <td>...</td><td>...</td> </tr>
    <tr><td>2 </td><td>329.1</td><td>50</td> </tr>
    <tr><td>2 </td><td>516.5</td><td>5002</td> </tr>
    <tr><td>2 </td><td>783.8</td><td>302</td> </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This layout is simple, but carries several advantages. Scalar columns are easily filtered along the page-level range index. This makes multi-dimensional queries easier to write and optimize. The arrays are transparently encoded and compressed by Parquet, so the data may still be stored compactly. The data must be stored as-is in order to use the page index so no additional obscuring transformations can be used.

<!-- The [zero run stripping](#zero-run-stripping) and [null marking](#null-marking) methods may still be employed as they only remove non-meaningful points from the array. -->

### Chunked Layout

When storing data arrays, the chunked layout treats one array, which must be sorted, as the "main" axis, cutting the array into chunks of a fixed size along that coordinate space (e.g. steps of 50 m/z) and taking the same segments from parallel arrays. The main axis chunks' start, end, and a repeated index are recorded as columns, and then each array may be encoded as-is or with an opaque transform (e.g. delta-encoding, Numpress). The start and end interval permits granular random access along the main axis as well as the source index. The top-level node is named `chunk` and it has a layout as shown below. The entity index column _MUST_ be the first column under `chunk`.

This example uses a delta-encoding for the m/z array chunks' values, which can be efficiently reconstructed with very high precision for 64-bit floats. The m/z values within the `mz_chunk_values` list aren't accessible to the page index, but the `_chunk_start` and `_chunk_end` columns are. The chunk values are still subject to Parquet encodings so they can be byte shuffled as well which further improves compression.

The chunked layout's column naming rules:

1. `<entity>_index` (integer): The index key for the entity this chunk belongs to.
2. `<array_name>_chunk_start` (float64): The first coordinate value in this chunk, where it _starts_ at inclusively. This array's entry in the [`array index`](#the-array-index)'s `buffer_format` _MUST_ be `chunk_start`.
3. `<array_name>_chunk_end` (float64): The last coordinate value in this chunk, where it _ends_ at inclusively. This array's entry in the [`array index`](#the-array-index)'s `buffer_format` _MUST_ be `chunk_end`.
4. `<array_name>_chunk_values` (list): The encoded coordinates from `array_name` according to the `chunk_encoding` column. This array's entry in the [`array index`](#the-array-index)'s `buffer_format` _MUST_ be `chunk_values`.
5. `chunk_encoding` (CURIE): The method by which `<array_name>_chunk_values` were encoded. See [Chunk Encodings](#chunk-encodings) for more details. This array's entry in the [`array index`](#the-array-index)'s `buffer_format` _MUST_ be `chunk_encoding`.

All other columns are expected to be `list` arrays whose names are simply their `array_name` as described in the index with `buffer_format` `chunk_secondary`, or surrogate arrays with the buffer format `chunk_transform`.

#### Splitting Data Into Chunks

The process for constructing a chunk table for a signal entry may break in any pattern so long as the chunks are non-overlapping and ascending. The chunking procedure needs to be `null`-aware, particularly aware of `null` pairs used to denote masked regions. An algorithm for producing equal width chunks is given below. The granularity of the chunking is configurable, trading off random access granularity vs. compression efficiency.

#### Chunk Encodings

##### Basic Encoding

Chunk Encoding Controlled Vocabulary: [`MS:1000576|no compression`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1000576)

When storing centroids or data that are not similarly spaced as is usually the case for pre-centroided spectra, but still want to use the chunked layout, no special encoding of the chunked values is necessary. The values within each chunk are written as-is to the chunk values array. This doesn't improve compressibility but it maintains a consistent schema for other entries that would benefit from a different encoding.

__Note__: The start point is _excluded_ from the chunk values array.

##### Delta Encoding

Chunk Encoding Controlled Vocabulary: [`MS:1003089|truncation, delta prediction and zlib compression`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1003089)

When working with data that is laid out on a locally (*almost*) uniform grid using 64-bit floats, it is possible to improve compression by computing a delta encoding of the coordinates.

__Note__: The start point is _excluded_ from the chunk values array.

##### Numpress Linear Encoding

Chunk Encoding Controlled Vocabulary: [`MS:1002312|MS-Numpress linear prediction compression`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1002312)

This uses the Numpress linear prediction method ([10.1074/mcp.O114.037879](https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(20)33083-8/fulltext)) to compress the chunk's values as raw bytes. Numpress creates a buffer containing an 8 byte fixed point, 4 byte value 0, 4 byte value 1, followed by 2 byte residuals for all subsequent values in the array. This means that the array is by definition not alignable to a 4- or 8-byte type. It also has no concept of nullity, which means it is _not compatible_ with [null marking](#null-marking).

To store Numpress linear encoded arrays, an extra column is added `<array_name>_numpress_linear_bytes` is added alongside the `<array_name>_chunk_values` column. It is a list of byte arrays (`large_list<u8>` in Arrow parlance, __not__ `large_binary`, see [discussion of string type "optimization"](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Intro.html#variable-length-binary-and-string)). The array index entry for this column _MUST_ have `buffer_format` of `chunk_transform` and the same array type, array name, data type, unit, and data processing ID as the `_chunk_values` column. The `transform` field in the index _MUST_ be `MS:1002312`.

__Note__: The start point is _INCLUDED_ from the chunk values array. It is a specific component of the Numpress encoded bytes.

### Opaque Array Transforms

In some cases, we might prefer to store data lossily in non-uniform, unaligned, or otherwise non-standard data types that don't have a physical representation in Parquet. MS-Numpress's short logged float (SLOF) and positive integer encodings are good examples of these cases. While the Numpress-Linear chunk encoding works for the coordinate dimension, we also support using other opaque transformations to encode the secondary arrays in chunks. These columns are also recorded in the `array index ` with `buffer_format` = `chunk_transform`, the `transform` field in the index must be the CURIE for the relevant encoding method, such as [`MS:1002314`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1002314) for MS-Numpress's SLOF encoding. The column's data type _MUST_ be a list of byte arrays, though the type in the `array index` _MUST_ be the decoded array's real type after decoding. The column names _SHOULD_ be of the form `<array_name>_<transform_name>_bytes`, e.g. `intensity_numpress_slof_bytes`.

### How to read a single entry from the chunked encoding

To read a single entry (e.g. spectrum, chromatogram) that is stored in chunks, the following procedure may be used:

0. Identify which columns are annotated as `chunk_start`, `chunk_end`, `chunk_encoding`, and `chunk_values` in the [`array index`](#the-array-index). The `<entity_type>_index` column **MUST** be the first column in the table, so it always has index 0.
1. Find the row group which contains the entry's index value by querying the row group-level metadata. Optionally, if the page index is available, find the row ranges for the pages that contain that index.
2. Read the selected row group (or data page row range) and filter the selected rows to only those whose `<entity_type>_index` column equals the entry's index.
3. Optionally, sort the rows with respect to their `chunk_start` column's value in appropriate order, usually ascending, for the quantity being measured.
4. Process each selected row, decoding its `chunk_values` column according to the `chunk_encoding` column and any `transform` listed in the relevant `array index`. Unpack the `chunk_secondary` columns and process any tranforms as necessary, accumulating each column's data arrays across rows. Processing transforms may require additional information from the `entry_type`'s metadata table.
5. If the entry has additional auxiliary arrays, they must be read from the metadata table and decoded.


## Why all these root nodes?

**Couldn't we just unwrap the top-level struct and move on with things?**

Perhaps, but the top-level structure leaves the door open for two use-cases:

1. Clear schema signaling. When you see `point` at the root of the schema, you know this is a [point layout](#point-layout), not a [chunked layout](#chunked-layout) file.
2. Unaligned proprietary data. A specialized writer or reader might wish to embed other information that is not directly connected to the primary schema's addressible unit (e.g. a spectrum, a data point), and this leaves open a door for that to be introduced. It is assumed that this is unlikely at this time, but it is a quantum physics universe.
3. More table packing. Early in mzPeak's design, we tried to pack tables together as much as possible as in the [packed parallel table](#packed-parallel-metadata-tables) layout, but this proved to be very inefficient to _write_ despite being no slower to _read_. This might have been an implementation detail, and not Parquet itself. We don't want to throw out the opportunity to return to that in the future, requiring a schema-breaking change rather than just how we get to the tables that break.


# Index File - `mzpeak_index.json`

An mzPeak archive is made up of multiple named files. To leave room for future files and avoid having to do complicated file name resolution, we use an index file that identifies the contents of each file. This broadly defines the kinds of schemas those files might have. The file _MUST_ be serialized with UTF8.

TODO: Add wavelength files to examples

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "name": "spectra_data.parquet",
      "entity_type": "spectrum",
      "data_kind": "data arrays"
    },
    {
      "name": "spectra_metadata.parquet",
      "entity_type": "spectrum",

      "entity_type": "chromatogram",
      "data_kind": "metadata"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Governed by JSONSchema `schema/mzpeak_index.json`

The `data_kind` and `entity_kind` fields are loose enumerations. They are expected to grow over time.

## Data Kind

The `data_kind` field tells the reader the semantics of the data stored in this file, and approximately what kind of schema to expect.

There are currently 5 controlled values for `data_kind`:

- `data arrays`: Expected to use one of the [point](#point-layout) or [chunked](#chunked-layout) layout. These files contain the signal data, usually in its "raw" form, for the `entity_type` being described.
- `peaks`: This, like `data arrays`, is expected to use the [point](#point-layout) or [chunked](#chunked-layout) layout as well. Where `data arrays` might store any kind of signal data, `peaks` implies that the data are processed and that there exists an entry in `data arrays` that is less refined. This is useful when storing both profile and centroid signal for a spectrum, for example.
- `metadata`: Expected to use the [packed parallel table](#packed-parallel-metadata-tables) layout. This describes the entity's metadata, everything but the homogenous signal arrays stored in the `data arrays` file. This file may still be large.
- `proprietary`: The layout and schema of this file is entirely the purview of the writer which may be an instrument vendor. These files should be ignored unless the reader _is_ for that instrument vendor. It may not be a Parquet file. Instrument vendors are encouraged to use this classification on binary files or other difficult to digest contents. Text or XML configuratin files may still be of interest to the broader community in an evolving metadata landscape.
- `other`: The file is none of the other listed types. This may not be a Parquet file.

Any value outside of these is assumed to be treated as `other`. Files labeled as `other`. Any files treated as `other` data kinds are implementation defined, as are `proprietary` files, but `other` files may be still be of interest to non-vendor readers.

### Adding a new `Data Kind`

This list is necessarily incomplete as new use cases are likely to emerge. For instance, it might be desirable to store extracted LC-(IM)-MS feature bounding boxes as a separate file.

1. Pick a name that will fit within the index JSON file. Prefer lower case names. i.e. `feature map` for extracted features
2. Pick a layout or layouts associated with this data kind. i.e. [packed parallel table](#packed-parallel-metadata-tables) for lists of bounding boxes with associated metadata.
3. Describe the relationships with valid [Entity Types](#entity-type) (see below). Prefer simple relationships like one-to-one or one-to-many. If no existing entity type is reasonable, create a new entity type. i.e. an LC-MS feature might associate with `spectrum`, but there isn't a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship between spectra and LC-MS, so a new entity type might be needed.

## Entity Type

The `entity_type` tells the reader what is _being_ described in this file, in concert with the `data_kind`. This makes helps the reader connect the right file to the right API.

There are currently 3 controlled values for `entity_type`

- `spectrum`: The file describes mass spectra, entities defined as occuring at a singular point in time, or as semantically close to this as possible in the face of framed or cycled acquisition, with a mass-related unit like m/z or neutral mass as the coordinate of measure.
- `chromatogram`: The file describes chromatograms or other measurements _over time_ like diagnostic traces. QUESTION: should these be called "traces" instead?
- `wavelength spectrum`: Similar to `spectrum`, except that the unit of measure is an electromagnetic wavelength measurement. There is substantially more heterogeneity in the types of analyzers that measure wavelengths compared to mass analyzers. Additionally, time series may be constructed around wavelengths but stored as `chromatogram` entries.
- `other`: The file is none of the other listed types. This may describe something not yet covered by the living specification.

Any value outside of these is assumed to be treated as `other`.

### Adding a new `Entity Type`

TODO: Expand this

# Spectrum Signal Data File - `spectra_data.parquet`

**File index entry:**

```json
{
  "name": "spectra_data.parquet",
  "entity_type": "spectrum",
  "data_kind": "data arrays"
}
```

The spectrum signal data is encoded using either [point layout](#point-layout) or [chunked layout](#chunked-layout). The `entity index` column _MUST_ be named `spectrum_index`, and if a time column is written alongside it, it _SHOULD_ be named `spectrum_time`. Non-mass spectra like UV or DAD spectra should be written in the [wavelength_spectra_data.parquet](#wavelength-spectrum-signal-data---wavelength_spectra_dataparquet) file.

When using [null marking](#null-marking), follow the [null semantics for signal data](#null-semantics-for-signal-data) with care for profile data.

Only profile spectra should be written to this file, centroid spectra, or processed, centroid views of profile spectra when storing both modes should be written to the [peak data](#spectrum-peak-data---spectra_peaksparquet) file. The number of points written to this file for a particular spectrum _MUST_ be written to the [`spectrum.MS_1003060_number_of_data_points`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1003060) column in the [`spectra_metadata.parquet`](#spectrum-metadata---spectra_metadataparquet) file to facilitate appropriate reading operation planning.

## Recommendations

When selecting a [Parquet encoding](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/) for columns, favor:

- `spectrum_index`: [delta encoding](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/#delta-encoding-delta_binary_packed--5). This encoding is ideal for repetitive or slowly increasing integer series.
- `spectrum_time`: [byte stream split](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/#byte-stream-split-byte_stream_split--9)
- m/z arrays: [byte stream split](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/#byte-stream-split-byte_stream_split--9), also called byte shuffling, or [RLE dictionary encoding](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/#dictionary-encoding-plain_dictionary--2-and-rle_dictionary--8) when there is ion mobility data.
- ion mobility arrays: [RLE dictionary encoding](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/#dictionary-encoding-plain_dictionary--2-and-rle_dictionary--8), byte shuffling tends to not be very helpful. Also consider increasing the dictionary page size.


# Spectrum Peak Data - `spectra_peaks.parquet`

**File index entry:**

```json
{
  "name": "spectra_peaks.parquet",
  "entity_type": "spectrum",
  "data_kind": "peaks"
}
```

The spectrum peak lists separately stored from the raw signal stored in [`spectra_data.parquet`](#spectrum-signal-data-file---spectra_dataparquet). The `entity index` column _MUST_ be named `spectrum_index`, and if a time column is written alongside it, it _SHOULD_ be named `spectrum_time`. Any centroid spectra _MUST_ be written to this file, not [`spectra_data.parquet`](#spectrum-signal-data-file---spectra_dataparquet). The number of peaks written for a given spectrum in this file _MUST_ be written to the [`spectrum.MS_1003059_number_of_peaks`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1003059) column in the [`spectra_metadata.parquet`](#spectrum-metadata---spectra_metadataparquet) file to facilitate reading operation planning.


# Spectrum Metadata - spectra_metadata.parquet

**File index entry:**

```json
{
  "name": "spectra_metadata.parquet",
  "entity_type": "spectrum",
  "data_kind": "metadata"
}
```

The [file level metadata](#file-level-metadata) for this Parquet file should include the following JSON-encoded metadata:
  - [`file_description`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobiusklein/mzpeak_prototyping/refs/heads/main/schema/file_description.json)
  - [`instrument_configuration_list`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobiusklein/mzpeak_prototyping/refs/heads/main/schema/instrument_configuration.json)
  - [`data_processing_method_list`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobiusklein/mzpeak_prototyping/refs/heads/main/schema/data_processing.json)
  - [`software_list`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobiusklein/mzpeak_prototyping/refs/heads/main/schema/software.json)
  - [`sample_list`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobiusklein/mzpeak_prototyping/refs/heads/main/schema/sample.json)
  - [`scan_settings_list`]() (TODO)
  - [`run`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobiusklein/mzpeak_prototyping/refs/heads/main/schema/ms_run.json)

This metadata table uses the [packed parallel metadata table](#packed-parallel-metadata-tables) schema. The parallel schemas are shown below. The general order of columns in unspecified, but `spectrum.index`, `scan.source_index`, `precursor.source_index`, and `selected_ion.source_index` _MUST_ be the first column of their respective schemas. Wherever these lists say _MAY_, that value may either be stored as a column or as an entry in the [parameter list](#the-parameters-list) but a column tends to make more sense if it is usually present.

- `spectrum` (group)
  - `index` (uint64): The ascending 0-based index.

# Chromatogram Signal Data - `chromatograms_data.parquet`

**File index entry:**

```json
{
  "name": "chromatograms_data.parquet",
  "entity_type": "chromatogram",
  "data_kind": "data arrays"
}
```

The chromatogram signal data is encoded using either [point layout](#point-layout) or [chunked layout](#chunked-layout). The `entity index` column _MUST_ be named `chromatogram_index`. The default primary axis for this type of signal data is a [`MS:1000595|time array`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1000595), though the unit is up to the writer.

## Recommendations

When selecting a [Parquet encoding](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/) for columns, favor:

- `chromatogram_index`: [delta encoding](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/#delta-encoding-delta_binary_packed--5). This encoding is ideal for repetitive or slowly increasing integer series.
- time arrays: [byte stream split](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/encodings/#byte-stream-split-byte_stream_split--9), also called byte shuffling.

# Wavelength Spectrum Signal Data - wavelength_spectra_data.parquet

**File index entry:**

```json
{
  "name": "wavelength_spectra_data.parquet",
  "entity_type": "wavelength spectrum",
  "data_kind": "data arrays"
}
```

The wavelength spectrum signal data is encoded using either [point layout](#point-layout) or [chunked layout](#chunked-layout). The `entity index` column _MUST_ be named `wavelength_spectrum_index`, and if a time column is written alongside it, it _SHOULD_ be named `wavelength_spectrum_time`. This _SHOULD_ only be present if wavelength spectra are included in the mzPeak archive.

When using [null marking](#null-marking), follow the [null semantics for signal data](#null-semantics-for-signal-data) with care for profile data.

# Wavelength Spectrum Metadata - `wavelength_spectra_metadata.parquet`

**File index entry:**

```json
{
  "name": "wavelength_spectra_metadata.parquet",
  "entity_type": "wavelength spectrum",
  "data_kind": "metadata"
}
```

This metadata table uses the [packed parallel metadata table](#packed-parallel-metadata-tables) schema. This should only be present if wavelength spectra are included in the mzPeak archive. The parallel schemas are shown below. The general order of columns in unspecified, but `spectrum.index` and `scan.source_index` _MUST_ be the first column of their respective schemas. Wherever these lists say _MAY_, that value may either be stored as a column or as an entry in the [parameter list](#the-parameters-list) but a column tends to make more sense if it is usually present. It mirrors the [spectrum metadata](#spectrum-metadata---spectra_metadataparquet) layout, but does not include a `precursor` or `selected_ion` facet because EMR spectra have not been observed with isolation and fragmentation yet.

This metadata is stored separately from the mass spectra, allowing the two different data modalities to have divergent schemas without inflating the number of empty columns, and for ease of searching, so the reader does not need to sort through mass spectra while looking for EMR spectra and vice-versa.

- `spectrum` (group)
  - `index` (uint64): The ascending 0-based index. This _MUST_ be incrementally increasing by 1 per entry and _SHOULD_ be written in time-sorted ascending order (QUESTION: Should there be a CV to denote this state?). This is the "primary key" for the `spectrum` schema, making it the root unit of addressability.
  - `id` (string): The "nativeID" string identifier for the spectrum, formatted according to to a [native identifier format](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MS_1000767). The specific nativeID format _SHOULD_ be specified in the [file level metadata](#file-level-metadata) under `.file_description.source_files[0].parameters`, as in mzML.
